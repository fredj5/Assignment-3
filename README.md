# Assignment-3

This program publishes temperature, humidity, and CO2 data to a public ThingSpeak channel, which can be viewed at this link: https://thingspeak.com/channels/2485147


# How to Run
It's as simple as downloading homework3.py and running the script. Because it uses an API key, it may restrict you from publishing the data, but it should run for anyone.
The script will run indefinitely once started, publishing updated sensor values to the ThingSpeak MQTT channel every 20 seconds.
